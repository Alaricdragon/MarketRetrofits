industry are extremely complicated. there is a lot of interaction going back and forwards here. this creates issues.

currently working on issue 7.

status of default industry and base industry:
    (current)
        current plan(complete):
            1)( in default instance, replace everything with a copy from baseIndustry
            2) in MarketRetrofit_BaseIndustry create 2 functions:
                2.a) one to call any data from itself
                2.b) one to set any data in itself
            3) in default instance, make it so i collect all data form MarketRetrofit_BaseIndustry.
            4) in MarketRetrofit_BaseIndustry, make it so i recompile all data from default instance
            5) in default instance, every time i call a baseIndustry function, do so from the industry that is being emulated right now.
            (NO. not worth it. let the peple have a slightly harder time with conversion, for a better time without)6) in MarketRetrofit_BaseIndustry, readd all removed functions. they can be handled, i think.
            7) in instance industry, apply 5 and 3.
            8)get all custom data storged in the primary industry
        issues:
            1)(canceled. being public is the lesser of evils. very easy to adapt to)  i set all functions in default instance to public. im going to try and set the ones that were protected back, and
                see if that makes it easier to connect to the old instance industry.
            2) regarding .super:
                its completely fine on default industry.
                it is not find on instance industry.
                instance industry super returns whatever active default industry is in use.
                this is a issue because it dose not return what the super should, and in fact just runs a different instance.
            3)(solved. not tested) population and infrastructure:
                -this industry has some confusing custom data. i need to complete the custom data set before i can upgrade it
                -(see "industrys with custom data that needs a way to be saved")
            4) init and init with parms in baseIndustry:
                issue is this causes issues. my current theory is that i should just run a super there, then run exstra data from active instance.
            5) i change active instance every function. this can cause issues when things are not unaplyed right.
            6) IMPORTANT: MarketRetrofits_DefaultInstanceIndustry does not call all its functions from CurrentIndustry.
            7) IMPORTANT: data handling error:
                data is gotten at the start of every function and set at the end of every function.
                issue: 2 functions. one that you call first, then calls a second function.
                second function changes data, then sets it.
                first function finishes running, overwrites data, and sets it.
            7.a) what instance industry / default instance industry is active again?
                i need to get what industry is active before i can set and get data.
                should be simple:
            7.b) i was using the wrong functions for getting / sending data.
                i should use / replace:
                    IndustryDataCleanup(this);
                    IndustryDataGet(industry);

            8) IMPORTANT: industry get data error
                right now all MarketRetrofitBaseIndustry function are ran through getActiveInstance.
                getActiveInstance sets a instance data to current industry.
                get data from instance runs through this...
                AAAAAAA
                -NOTE: data passing between instance industry and default industry:
                    so i don't know when i get data from a default industry or a active one, simply because
                    i need to comunacate that somehow.
                    theory:
                        create a function in instance industry that sends, then gets data from default industry.
                        this would mean that any data gotten would be instantly sent no no n on o n on no no no no
                        issue:
                            function can run from default industry, calling the data ladder, then trying to set data to
                            default instance.

        solutions:
            2)
                create a set of functions in MarketRetrofitBaseIndustry that call the super of that class?
                or create them in default industry. testing required.
                ...
                or create said functions in instance industry, there super would call defalt industry, then classes that
                exstend instance industry would beable to accses said functions.
            5) make it so i only change my 'active industry' only after i run apply / init with parms.
                whatever one comes first, really.
            6) make it call all its functions from Current industry.
                done. all functions added
            7) this will require a solution to run cleanly..
                things that help: every function this apply to will run through the CurrentIndustry.
                theory: have 2 sets of memory, + active instance?
                theory: a list of 'last instance' to save data to.
                    1) when a instance is set to run, add instance to list
                    2) when new instance is gotten, get data from last inputted last instance
                    3) when a instance stops running, get data from last instance, and apply it to second last instance
                        -set the first instance to be the memory of the current industry.
                        -issue: possible memory leak: some functions call from baseIndustry.speck, and not from base industry.
                                this means that the list will increase in size forever in some cases... this is a issue
                                can be mitigated by making.....
            7.a) how to do this?
                simple, reverse order of getData and getExtraData.
                have getExtraData and setExtraData return the the the the the the the the issue.
                this is already available though. it has to be to run the code..
                not what im looking for.
                already available data exists. data is attached to different things...
                the only times i can get confused are when a instance industry calls a default.
                i will already be running the data through there. save the industry as i increase the ladder.
                then pass the data on as i reduce the ladder.

            7.b) incorrect functions edited. edits undone.
                IndustryDataCleanup(this);
                IndustryDataGet(industry);
                1) remove all uses of said functions.
                2) create and run 2 MarketRetrofitBaseIndustry functions, to replace said functions.
                3) functions should be able to get/set data from/to saved instance industry's, or the baseIndustry itself, if required.

            8) this will require a messy solution:
                when getting running a default industry from a instance industry, call the data with the function that
                were made in solutions 7. this will raise the item up the ladder a little, letting data be sent back and forth
                to and from the default instance to the instance industry.
        incomplete:

        ISSUE:
            different data types might require a different way to get them from null.
            if a null data type is inputted, it cannot be set to any primitive data type. like at all.
            solution: have different functions to get data from different primitive types.

            solution(failed): data and infermation can be set from null this way.
                      but only if its null. any other value will fail.
                boolean a = Boolean.parseBoolean(null);
                int b = Integer.parseInt(null);
                float c = Float.parseFloat(null);
                double d = Double.parseDouble(null);
                MarketRetorfits_ExstraData e = null;
                String f = null;
                char g = null;//char cannot get from null.

                a = 0;//cant
                b = 0;
                c = 0;
                d = 0;
                e = 0;//cant
                f = 0;//cant
                g = 0;
            final solution: have get data have a the ability to get a 'type' of data.
            make Exstra data public, so it can be the way one gets and sets data

            new issue:
            sometimes a defalt industry will call functions that will change exstra data.
            i must call set and get exstra data before and after said function, to avoid issues...
            have not added this yet. will do so soon

            HERE new solution:
            give every instance industry its own 'extra data' class. set and get the extra data after and before running data. its maddeningly simple.
