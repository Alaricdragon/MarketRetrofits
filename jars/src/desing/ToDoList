MOVED industry.csv FILE TO 'old' FOLDER. MOVE BACK TO 'campaing' to reactavate
questions:
    1) is there a way to edit the 'hazard rating' of a 'market condition' conditionally? or to otherwise change the 'hazard' of a 'market condition' with code?
    2) is there a way to edit the code that runs when you click the 'hazard pay' button on the market screen?
    3) is there a way to edit the code that runs when you click the 'free port' button on the market screen?
    4) is there a way to change the text and descriptions for the 'free port' and 'hazard pay' buttons on the market screen? ether conditionally or overall?
create the list of wanted libarys:
    1) industry replacer (disabled for now) (reason: extra unacceptable lag)
        -to fix, minimize possible causes of lag, like for example, the number of data transfers, and the hundreds of if statements.
        -possibility: remove about 95% of functions. keep all descriptions, images, apply/unapply, core and improve functions, remove checking for current industry every time.
        -possability: remove ALL data transfer. have the code run the stored industry directly. when the industry changes, have a function that lets the new industry take whatever it wants from the old one. then i dont need to worry about things.
    2) condition replacer
        -replaces functions in market conditions with ones of my own.
        notes:
            hazard rating is stored in the '\data\campaign\procgen\condition_gen_data.csv'.
                -this looks very hard to do anything with....
                -market.getHazard().modifyFlat(id, hazard, condition.getName()); is how the market changes what the hazard is for said condition.
                -BaseHazardCondition class? is this the thing?
                IDEA:
                    1) replace everything in '\data\campaign\procgen\condition_gen_data.csv' with my own custom hazard things, that allow for conditional hazards (with the defalt being the inputed values...)
                    2) allow some type of 'condition replacer' to replace hazard of the same ID of this. link the IDs of the 'condition replacer' to the ones used in the market condition classes themselves.
            all other modifiers seem to be stored in the '\data\campaign\market_conditions.csv'
                -this looks almost easy to override...
                IDEA:
                    1) replace everything in '\data\campaign\market_conditions.csv' with my own code that will act as a 'shell' of the normal code..
                    2) add a new class in 'condition replacer' that acts as the 'filling' of a given market condition...
                    3) set that 'condition replacer' to have the same functions as all the classes it replaced.
    3)(functional) supply demand library
        -allows the mass or pacific changing of supply or demand on a industry
        issues:
            might possibly not effect the cargo supply fleets carry to and from the market? need to check that because i might be wrong.
    4) growth changer
        -allows one to remove or add new growth from outside of conditions or industry
    5) hazard changer
        -allows for changing in the hazard button name, description, looks, and function.
    6) free port changer
        -allows the change in the free-port name, and description.
