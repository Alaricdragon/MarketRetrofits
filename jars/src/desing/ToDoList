MOVED industry.csv FILE TO 'old' FOLDER. MOVE BACK TO 'campaing' to reactavate
create the list of wanted libarys:
    1) industry replacer (disabled for now) (reason: extra unacceptable lag)
        -to fix, minimize possible causes of lag, like for example, the number of data transfers, and the hundreds of if statements.
        -possibility: remove about 95% of functions. keep all descriptions, images, apply/unapply. remove checking for current industry every time.
        -possability: remove ALL data transfer. have the code run the stored industry directly
    2) condition replacer
        -replaces functions in market conditions with ones of my own.
    3) supply demand libary (functional)
        -allows the mass or pacific changing of supply or demand on a industry
    4) growth changer
        -allows one to remove or add new growth from outside of conditions or industry
    5) hazard changer
        -allows for changing in the hazard button name, description, looks, and function.
    6) free port changer
        -allows the change in the free-port name, and description.
    7) found a market change
        -allows players to have there own requirements and addition code run when founding a market. multiple options available.
to do list:
    ExtraData:
        make the data organize itself with that fast find method.
    supplyDemandLibary:
        create masterList:
            -(done)the masterList is an collection of lists. its were all lists ever made are stored.
            -(done)every time an list is added/requested with an industry reference that dose not exist, creates an new set of lists for that industry reference.
            -remembers weather or not an industry has an MarketRetrofits reference, and if so, runs all change data in that industry?
        (done)create lists:
            -lists are collection of sets. one list handles one industry.
            -an list holds an organized by order list of all 'changes', with references back to said 'changes' 'set'. organized by order.
            -when activated, an list runs through all changes in order, each time it reaches an new set, it checks to see if that set is valid.
            -list holds references to its required industry ID.
        (done)create sets
            -sets are were i calculate and run code. they decide what is allowed, and what is not.
            -they also run and calculate all changes in the order they want to be calculated in.
            -should be able to automatically apply itself to to the 'lists' that are required for its wanted industry.
        (done)finish testing the 'applyMutableStat' function in supplyBase.
            -i made the class extend an MutableState. no idea if this is the right call or not.
        (done) test the following:
            -demandSwap
            -supplySwap
            -supplyAdd
            -demandAdd
