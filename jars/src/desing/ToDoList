current:
MOVED industry.csv FILE TO 'old' FOLDER. MOVE BACK TO 'campaing' to reactavate
create the list of wanted libarys:
    1) industry replacer (disabled for now) (reason: extra unacceptable lag)
        -to fix, minimize possible causes of lag, like for example, the number of data transfers, and the hundreds of if statements.
        -possibility: remove about 95% of functions. keep all descriptions, images, apply/unapply, core and improve functions, remove checking for current industry every time.
        -possability: remove ALL data transfer. have the code run the stored industry directly. when the industry changes, have a function that lets the new industry take whatever it wants from the old one. then i dont need to worry about things.
    2) condition replacer
        -replaces functions in market conditions with ones of my own.
    3) supply demand library (functional)
        -allows the mass or pacific changing of supply or demand on a industry
        issues:
            might possibly not effect the cargo supply fleets carry to and from the market? need to check that because i might be wrong.
    4) growth changer
        -allows one to remove or add new growth from outside of conditions or industry
    5) hazard changer
        -allows for changing in the hazard button name, description, looks, and function.
    6) free port changer
        -allows the change in the free-port name, and description.
    7) found a market change
        -allows players to have there own requirements and addition code run when founding a market. multiple options available.
        -here is the plan for this:
            1)(done) survey plugging: the survey plugging has a function called found outpost. this is founding a market, and can be set to any commodities.
                -need to have this with a built in compatibility patch for crew replacer, or im going to have issues.
                -will need to beable to change what function is running based off a variable.
            2)(done) edit the rules that normal found a market.
                -NOTE:
                    OK: in the base game, when there is no jump onits, the game shows some text about how 'establishing a colonly is not a option', just on the main screen. also, the button to do so is greyed out.
                    i need to remove this text, provided there is a foundable market on this world.
                    i also need to grey out the found a market text if there is no foundable market on this world.
                -need to replace the thing that greys out the market found button if your in a 'closed system'. replace it with a custom function that detects if there is any type of market available to found.
                    -(DONE)surveySystemIsCutOffCanNotColonize: remove text and script. make this trigger MarketRetrofits_customMarketFounding_CutOffCanNotColonize.
                    -(Done. untested)surveyPrintHostilesTextEstColony: (im unsure how this works. might need to experiment. ) remove text and script. make this trigger MarketRetrofits_customMakretFounder_HostilesAreAround.
                        -NOTE: i need to test this one. i have to find a spot that i can find some hostile fleets and a market to interact with...
                        -also getting patrols to chase you around and round does not work. i need something a letter more hostile then that. maybe i need luna lib for this?
                    -(DONE)surveyAddOptionPerformedAlready: change its options to a new option that creates a list of possible markets types, and lets you click on one of them.
                    -(not required)surveyOptionPerformSurvey: founds a market (i think?).

                -(done)need to replace the script for 'hostile activity nearby', with my own script that does not prevent founding a market provided you have a market type that is foundable.
                    -the rules for this are:
                        surveyPrintHostilesTextEstColony

                -(NO LONGER REQUIRED)put this somewhere:
                    when i leave the space / found a market, set MarketRetrofits_MarketFounderMasterList. hostilesTemp && noJumpTemp to false.

            3)(done) create the 'market founder' class. it will require the following functions:
                3.1)(done) a function to get the required resources to found a market.
                3.2)(done) a function to set what the text is named for there own market.
                3.3)(done) a function to set the description of that market type.
                3.4)(done) a function to deside if this market type is valid on this world.
                3.5)(done) a function to run custom code -after- the market has been founded.
            4)(done) a 'market founder master list' class. it will hold and allow you to aquire other market founders.
                this is hard to understand..
                so i don't think i can run the dialog from the inputed dialog pluging.
                well, i might beable to, but i dont understand how to form options so im not even goin to try.
                so heres what im going to do:
                1)(done)create a new sell class. it will run a dialog interaction thing. (mimic AIRetrofits_RobotForgeDiologPlugin2 form AIRetrofits.)
                2)(done)make a cass for the main menu, called MarketRetrofits_customMarketFounder_dialog
                3)(done) make a way for moders to render a system impossible to colonize.
                    -why? simple. its possible to make a market that can conlinize any system, however this comes with risks. like for example
                     a system being temporarily, and the user losing all there markets they colonized within. or worse, incountering a hard crash.
                     so im going to install a system to prevent this.
            5)(done) make a interaction dialog plugin for displaying my list of available markets at a given time.
                -this needs to:
                1)(done) read all the items in the master list, and display options for every valid market.
                2)(done) allow the user to click on any option, with will:
                    a)(done) run a description page, with a continue button at the bottom, the will move onto the found a market screen.
                    b)(done) run a custom dialog plugin thats stored in a given market founder.
                    c)(done) run the found a market screen.
                3)(done) allow so many items to show up per page, with a next / last button.
                4)(done) a back button, to return to the main screen of the world. (the one were you survey and things.)
            6(done) options:
                add all text to the settings file.
                add relevent options for the dialog to the settings file
            7(done) a way to safely trigger the exstra code for founding a market of a player, hopefully with no misfires.
                1)(done) set up a listiner, that if that player founds a market on a world they were just on, runs the market founding world.
                2)(done) set up a way to reset the market im currently looking at after i leave it, so i dont have situations were the player starts to found a market, leaves, then another mod founds a market there, and all the code that was running is triggered all at once. would suck.
                    -how would i even do that? is there a way to say 'hey, you left a market?'
            8)(done) documentation
                -need to write out all the documentation for this inter section of code.
                -only need to write the read me, and the function descriptions for MarketRetrofits_MarketFounderMasterList
            9() touchups:
                1) (done)create a way to display / get a option for a market founder.
                2) (done)create a way boolean, that makes the option appear greyed out if unusable, as apposed to just not being there.
                3) (done)make marketfounders automatically add themselves to market retrofits on creation.
