MOVED industry.csv FILE TO 'old' FOLDER. MOVE BACK TO 'campaing' to reactavate
create the list of wanted libarys:
    1) industry replacer (disabled for now) (reason: extra unacceptable lag)
        -to fix, minimize possible causes of lag, like for example, the number of data transfers, and the hundreds of if statements.
        -possibility: remove about 95% of functions. keep all descriptions, images, apply/unapply. remove checking for current industry every time.
        -possability: remove ALL data transfer. have the code run the stored industry directly. when the industry changes, have a function that lets the new industry take whatever it wants from the old one. then i dont need to worry about things.
    2) condition replacer
        -replaces functions in market conditions with ones of my own.
    3) supply demand library (functional)
        -allows the mass or pacific changing of supply or demand on a industry
        issues:
            might possibly not effect the cargo supply fleets carry to and from the market? need to check that because i might be wrong.
    4) growth changer
        -allows one to remove or add new growth from outside of conditions or industry
    5) hazard changer
        -allows for changing in the hazard button name, description, looks, and function.
    6) free port changer
        -allows the change in the free-port name, and description.
    7) found a market change
        -allows players to have there own requirements and addition code run when founding a market. multiple options available.
        -here is the plan for this:
            1)(done) survey plugging: the survey plugging has a function called found outpost. this is founding a market, and can be set to any commodities.
                -need to have this with a built in compatibility patch for crew replacer, or im going to have issues.
                -will need to beable to change what function is running based off a variable.
            2)(very asic started) edit the rules that normal found a market.
                -need to replace the thing that greys out the market found button if your in a 'closed system'. replace it with a custom function that detects if there is any type of market available to found.
                    -surveySystemIsCutOffCanNotColonize: add a extra condition that only returns true if -every- possible colony type is not OK with its market being cut off from hyperspace.
                    -surveyPrintHostilesTextEstColony: add a extra condition that only returns true if -every- possible colony type is not OK with being founding well under pressure.
                    -surveyAddOptionPerformedAlready: change its options to a new option that creates a list of possible markets types, and lets you click on one of them.
                    -MarketRetrofits_FoundAMarket: runs what surveyAddOptionPreformedAlready normally does. runs only when clicking a item from the list formed in surveyAddOptionPerformedAlready. sends a little bit of extra data back to the survey plugin.
            3)(started) create the 'market founder' class. it will require the following functions:
                3.1) a function to get the required resources to found a market.
                3.2) a function to set what the text is named for there own market.
                3.3) a function to set the description of that market type.
                3.4) a function to deside if this market type is valid on this world.
                3.5) a function to run custom code -after- the market has been founded.
            4)(started) a 'market founder master list' class. it will hold and allow you to aquire other market founders.
