MOVED industry.csv FILE TO 'old' FOLDER. MOVE BACK TO 'campaing' to reactavate
to do list:
    Industry Replacer:
        see new folder called 'industry replaced'
supplyDemandLibary:
    create masterList:
        -(done)the masterList is an collection of lists. its were all lists ever made are stored.
        -(done)every time an list is added/requested with an industry reference that dose not exist, creates an new set of lists for that industry reference.
        -remembers weather or not an industry has an MarketRetrofits reference, and if so, runs all change data in that industry?
    (done)create lists:
        -lists are collection of sets. one list handles one industry.
        -an list holds an organized by order list of all 'changes', with references back to said 'changes' 'set'. organized by order.
        -when activated, an list runs through all changes in order, each time it reaches an new set, it checks to see if that set is valid.
        -list holds references to its required industry ID.
    (done)create sets
        -sets are were i calculate and run code. they decide what is allowed, and what is not.
        -they also run and calculate all changes in the order they want to be calculated in.
        -should be able to automatically apply itself to to the 'lists' that are required for its wanted industry.
    (done)finish testing the 'applyMutableStat' function in supplyBase.
        -i made the class extend an MutableState. no idea if this is the right call or not.
    (done) test the following:
        -demandSwap
        -supplySwap
        -supplyAdd
        -demandAdd
