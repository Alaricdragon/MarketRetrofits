           MarketRetrofits_InitCombatabilityPatches
           MarketRetrofits_CrewReplacer_patch

    save compatible with any older version
    new
        -recreated the supply demand library (now called Commodity Changer in notes and code).
        -see documentation at (add link here)
        (may contain bugs, but tests showed it was stable. should be no risk of breaking your game.)

    notes:
        i said i was going to release supply demand library a while ago, but the project went out of control. i though i could
        complete the basics of all the library's i wanted to make, but i could not. so this is late now, with little to show. oh well..
