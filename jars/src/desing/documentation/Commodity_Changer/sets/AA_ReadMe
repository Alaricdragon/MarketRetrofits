regarding sets:

sets are were most of the complexity can com into play in this library. they allow you to have changes only apply conditional, provided you
override the public boolean active(Industry industry) function.

the fact there are two types of sets might be confusing, but the diffrence is simple:

MarketRetrofit_CCSetGenral is applied to all industry's, and is saved in MarketRetrofit_CCMasterList automatically on creation

MarketRetrofit_CCIndustrySet is implied to any industry(s) you want, and requires you to run the function
applyToIndustry(String Industry) were Industry is the ID of Industry you want the set to apply its changes to. can be applied to as many industry as you want
