this libarys function revolves around added new 'establish a market screens'.
said screens can have there own requirements, conditions that disable the ability to add said screens, and can be made to run code after you found a market with one of them.
in this there are 2 parts:
1) MarketRetrofits_MarketFounder
    -this is what desides what your market costs, what the option to sellect it looks like, the market description, the exstra code you want to run when a market is found useing it is ran exstra
    -for most users this should be the only part of this mini-library that you should interface with.
    -any MarketRetrofits_MarketFounder that is created is automatically added to MarketRetrofits_MarketFounderMasterList

    how to use:
        1) create a class that extends MarketRetrofits_MarketFounder. the inputed id must be diffrent from any other market founders ID, or it will overwrite / be overwriten. use something like "modname_colonlyType" as your name, to help avoid this.
        2) change relevent values (like setting canFoundWithoutJumpPonits = true; if you want your market to be foundable in systems with no hyperstpace access.) view the MarketRetrofits_MarketFounder documentation for all variables.
        3) overwrite relevent functions. some examples of functions you might want to overwrite are:
            3.a) public Map<String, Integer> getOutpostConsumed(SectorEntityToken planet), to change what your market costs.
            3.b) public void runCodeAfterFoundingMarket(SectorEntityToken planet), if you want to run code on a market just as it is created.
            3.c) public boolean canEstablishAMarketHere(SectorEntityToken planet,boolean hostileActivity,boolean cutOffFromHyperspace), to change weather or not a market is findable at a given location, based off more data then just the booleans.
            3.d) view the MarketRetrofits_MarketFounder documentation for all functions this class uses.

2) MarketRetrofits_MarketFounderMasterList
    -this is were the MarketRetrofits_MarketFounder are stored, and can be accessed.
    -this is useful for moders that want to use the different MarketRetrofits_MarketFounder's stored here, to for example, found a market a diffrent way. or whatever.
    -this will not be usefull for most users. most of you will never have any reason at all to do anything with this. so dont worry about doing so.
