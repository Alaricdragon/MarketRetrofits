MarketRetrofit IndustryChanger:
    broken instances:

        MarketRetrofit_MilitaryBaseInstance:
            breaks save files.
            how? it says its trying to convert itself into a root manager:
            com.thoughtworks.xstream.converters.ConversionException:
                Cannot convert type
                data.scripts.industries.Implementation.defaultIndustrys.MarketRetrofit_MilitaryBaseInstance
                to type
                com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.campaign.fleets.RouteManager$RouteFleetSpawner
             were & why this happens in unknown.

         MarketRetrofit_MiningInstance & MarketRetrofit_FarmingInstance:
            for a unknown reason, at random, will apply the same -extremely high- output values.
            running theory is that the output is a combination of -all- output on the map.
            why? i think its because the CSV files is making specs of every industry it calls? and instanceIndustry is not.

        MarketRetrofit_OrbitalStationInstance:
            for a known reason, is NOT updating stations at all.
            (dose remove them if you remove the industry though)
            reason:
            it calls for a last station, and a new station, and a station update thing.
            i just need to change the 'this' for something more workable.
                -NOT GOING TO WORK.
                one instance of 'this' wants to look at previous instances of 'this' and wants them to have particle files.
                theory: impl folder, were the thing is applyed in the first place... yes...
                    -if i move that data there, i will need to have it grab every instance of said data there.
