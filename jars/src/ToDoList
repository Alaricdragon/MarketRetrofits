ALL MILTARY BASES DISABLED IN INDUSTRY.CSV FILE. REACTAVATE TO TEST

MarketRetrofit IndustryChanger:
    (Fixed)BUG:
        -mining industry and farming has like 30X supply or demand at random? need to look into this...
        -patralHQ, milltaryBase and HighCommand DO NOT deploy patrols from the faction they should.
            theory: this may be caused by buggy bugs, do to the fact that the industry no longer exstends the required types (even though the used instance dose)
            in this vain, -anything- that extends things may need to have there extensions added to market retrofit before this all works.
            theory: dose haveing all industrys implement all things resalt in issues? if so, i may need to make my own classes that i can implement on will that do the required things.
            -UPDATE: attempted this. it worked* but failed at the same time. the issue: implementing something calls the function directly. i want the function to be called through the industry.
            sollution? have all instances NOT implement. have the base industry implement. this should work.
            so tired right now. i will have to spend some time and fix this tomorrow.
            ---
            attempted a hot fix. failed. every instance industry that implements something applys it somewere else. the issue? if i dont set them to be a item, they are not one, if that makes sense.
            the sollotion? make my own interface modals that are usable and let a class inharent the right values for this to work? maybe...
            that also might not be the issue, and it might have more to do with the issues that are being caused by the market assing issues.
            //(seems like i fixed that by moveing some things around)Note: the only factions with patrols are eater 'neutral' or 'pirates' it seems random and the same for all worlds?
            --
            i currently have a hot fix active that is called 'if(route == null){return;}' in both miltary base and lions gaurd HQ instances'.
            this prevents a random crash from crashing my game. but i fear it will have issues if left in the code.
            OBJECTIVE: run some type of console log through the code. this -should- tell me if the industry is having market issues.
            causes: i -think- it might be from wrong market ID issues.
                    why? because there is no check by default (so it always works under normal conditions.). something has to be messing up, and unless having the instance exstend the industry is that important, there is alsmost nothing else it can be

            Theory: use 'getMarket' to determine market. in BaseIndustry. remove the override to getMarket.
        -Theroy bug:    i have reason to think that the market is not being assigned right. this may be causing issues with things like patrol fleets spawning
                        possable causes? it might have something to do with exstended classes not haveing the same instance. if so, i might need to do something like getMarket() instead of this.market. that might work?
    -finish industry list so it remembers its industry instances in prioriity order.
    -finish added all the default instances for all the base game industry's.
    -test and make sure this works for every industry i activate. NOTE: dose not play nice with saves when i actavate a new industry.

    did testing. it seemed the issue was something to do with markets. but i am unsure what.
    did a few things:
        1) added a way to get the used industry. so i replaced all of 'this' with 'getIndustry()'
        2) removed all implementations. all data can be ran through BaseIndustry. all things can be set with '(cast)getIndustry()'
    that seemed to fix it.

    see if i require to change all 'market' to 'getMarket()'
    FIX EVERYTHING IN ISSUES.
        -might be because im not useing instances of instance industry (haha)
    MarketRetrofit_OrbitalStationInstance:
        need to replace 'this' with '(option cast)getIndustry()'
        need to remove its implements.
        not doing so now because im scared of it.
    MarketRetrofit_PopulationInstance
        need to replace one more 'this' with '(option cast)getIndustry()'


supplyDemandLibary:
    create masterList:
        -(done)the masterList is an collection of lists. its were all lists ever made are stored.
        -(done)every time an list is added/requested with an industry reference that dose not exist, creates an new set of lists for that industry reference.
        -remembers weather or not an industry has an MarketRetrofits reference, and if so, runs all change data in that industry?
    (done)create lists:
        -lists are collection of sets. one list handles one industry.
        -an list holds an organized by order list of all 'changes', with references back to said 'changes' 'set'. organized by order.
        -when activated, an list runs through all changes in order, each time it reaches an new set, it checks to see if that set is valid.
        -list holds references to its required industry ID.
    (done)create sets
        -sets are were i calculate and run code. they decide what is allowed, and what is not.
        -they also run and calculate all changes in the order they want to be calculated in.
        -should be able to automatically apply itself to to the 'lists' that are required for its wanted industry.
    (done)finish testing the 'applyMutableStat' function in supplyBase.
        -i made the class extend an MutableState. no idea if this is the right call or not.
    (done) test the following:
        -demandSwap
        -supplySwap
        -supplyAdd
        -demandAdd
