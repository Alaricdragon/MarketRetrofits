MarketRetrofit IndustryChanger:
    BUG:
        -mining industry and farming has like 30X supply or demand at random? need to look into this...
        -patralHQ, milltaryBase and HighCommand DO NOT deploy patrols from the faction they should.
            theory: this may be caused by buggy bugs, do to the fact that the industry no longer exstends the required types (even though the used instance dose)
            in this vain, -anything- that extends things may need to have there extensions added to market retrofit before this all works.
            theory: dose haveing all industrys implement all things resalt in issues? if so, i may need to make my own classes that i can implement on will that do the required things.
            -UPDATE: attempted this. it worked* but failed at the same time. the issue: implementing something calls the function directly. i want the function to be called through the industry.
            sollution? have all instances NOT implement. have the base industry implement. this should work.
            so tired right now. i will have to spend some time and fix this tomorrow.
    -finish industry list so it remembers its industry instances in prioriity order.
    -finish added all the default instances for all the base game industry's.
    -test and make sure this works for every industry i activate. NOTE: dose not play nice with saves when i actavate a new industry.

    create masterList:
        -(done)the masterList is an collection of lists. its were all lists ever made are stored.
        -(done)every time an list is added/requested with an industry reference that dose not exist, creates an new set of lists for that industry reference.
        -remembers weather or not an industry has an MarketRetrofits reference, and if so, runs all change data in that industry?
    (done)create lists:
        -lists are collection of sets. one list handles one industry.
        -an list holds an organized by order list of all 'changes', with references back to said 'changes' 'set'. organized by order.
        -when activated, an list runs through all changes in order, each time it reaches an new set, it checks to see if that set is valid.
        -list holds references to its required industry ID.
    (done)create sets
        -sets are were i calculate and run code. they decide what is allowed, and what is not.
        -they also run and calculate all changes in the order they want to be calculated in.
        -should be able to automatically apply itself to to the 'lists' that are required for its wanted industry.
    (done)finish testing the 'applyMutableStat' function in supplyBase.
        -i made the class extend an MutableState. no idea if this is the right call or not.
    (done) test the following:
        -demandSwap
        -supplySwap
        -supplyAdd
        -demandAdd
