# Overall idea of this project
  build an system that lets modders change the supply/demand/growth/effects of industries and markets conditionaly
  why? because i want to have an market have some completely different versions of already existing industries, and if anyone else wants to do the same, we would need an compatibility patch, that might not be possible to add.
  yes, i know its possible to apply blanket changes to industries, but this is for conditional industries.
